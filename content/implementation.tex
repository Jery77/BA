\chapter{Implementation}\label{chap:imp}
This chapter provides an information about the implementation of the framework and its elements, whose behavior was described in chapter \ref{chap:conarch}.
Java language was chosen, because of its simplicity and strength. 
In this language, the elements are represented by classes.
Java uses additional kind of packages which describe third-party modules and make programming easier. 
The used Java packages will be mentioned here and the necessary license will be listed in the "NOTICE.txt" file in the source code's root folder.

\section{Global elements}
This section describes the elements used throughout the whole framework's execution.
A ZIP handler provides a functionality to operate ZIP archives, a CSAR handler keeps an interface to interact with a CSAR and a Utils helps to solve problems common to other elements.

\subsection*{Zip handler}
This is a small element with straight functionality. 
It serves to pack and unpack ZIP archives which are used by the CSAR standard.
It was decided to use the $java$.$utils$.$zip$ package for this task.
The functions of archiving and unarchiving are called $zipIt$ and $unZipIt$ respectively. 

\subsection*{CSAR handler}
This element provides an interface to access the CSAR content and stores information about files associated with it.
The most valuable data are the name of a temporary extraction folder, the list of files from the input CSAR, the meta-file entry, and the architecture of the target platform.
All this data is encapsulated into the CSAR handler.
The set of public functions allowing to operate with this element is available.
\begin{itemize}
	\item $unpack$ and $pack$ functions are used to extract the CSAR into the temporary folder and pack the folder to the output CSAR. 
	These functions use the $ZIP$~$handler$.
	\item $getFiles$ returns the list with files presented by the input CSAR.
	\item $getFolder$ returns the path to the folder where the CSAR was extracted.
	\item $getArchitecture$ returns the chosen architecture of the target platform.
	\item $addFileToMeta$ adds information about the new file to the meta-data.
\end{itemize}
Here is an example usage of the element.
When the CSAR handler extracts the input CSAR to the temporary extraction folder during the $unpack$'s call, it saves the folder's name. 
Then other elements can use the $getFolder$ function to get this name and access the data.

\subsection*{Utils}
This class provides the $createFile$, $getPathLength$, and $correctName$ methods used by many other elements.
The main purpose of these functions is to make the code cleaner. \\
Using the $createFile$ an element can create a file with the given content.
The $getPathLength$ function returns the deep of the given file's path and it is very useful for creating references between files.\\
OpenTOSCA uses some limitations to names of TOSCA nodes. 
Those names can't contain slashes, dots and so on.
To obtain an acceptable name from a given name the function $correctName$ can be used.

\section{References resolver}
This is the main module which starts by framework startup and is executed into three stages: preprocessing, processing and finishing.

\subsection*{Preprocessing}
At the preprocessing stage, the CSAR is unpacked, common \gls{tosca} definitions are generated and internal dependencies trees are built. 
%
%\subsubsection*{Unpacking}
As the first step, a user interface is provided to get the names of the input CSAR, output CSAR and the architecture of the final platform.
To unpack the CSAR the function $unpack$ from the CSAR handler is used.\\
%
%\subsubsection*{Generating TOSCA Definitions}
The $javax$.$xml$.$bind$ package was chosen for creating the common TOSCA definition. 
This Java package allows to generate a description - Java class describing an XML document. 
Those documents contain the following definitions.
\begin{itemize}
	\item $DependsOn$ and $PreDependsOn$ describe Relationship Types %(Described in the section \nameref{subs:reltype})
	  between packages.% (described in the section \nameref{subs:dep}). 
	\item $Package$ $Artifact$ defines a deployment Artifact Type for a package installation data.
	\item $Script$ $Artifact$ specify an implementation Artifact Type for a script installing a package.
	\item $Ansible$ $Playbook$ represent a deployment Artifact Type for a package installation via an ansible playbook.
\end{itemize}
An example description of the $Script$ $Artifact$ can be found in listing~\ref{lst:scripttype}.
Each description is represented by a separate Java class.\\
%
%\subsubsection*{Build internal dependencies trees}\label{subs:imp_findintref}
%Internal dependencies are mainly used by the \nameref{subs:archtop}.
%Therefore, these two modules were combined within the one Java class named $Topology$~$Handler$.
To build internal dependencies trees the topology handler described in section \ref{sec:imptophan} is used. 

\subsection*{Processing}
During this stage, all language modules listed in the framework are started.
For the references resolver element that is only two strings of code, but they start the main functionality of the framework.
The languages modules check all files presented in the input CSAR. 
The list of these files is stored in the CSAR handler, a pointer to which the modules became during their instantiation and translate to the corresponding package manager modules.
This system allows the modules to access the CSAR's content at any time.
%Since the language modules are stored in $language$ variable, this simple stage can be presented by the listing~\ref{lst:start_lang}.
%\begin{Listing}
%\caption{The processing stage}
%\label{lst:start_lang}
%\begin{lstlisting}
%for (Language l : languages)
%	l.proceed(cr);
%\end{lstlisting}
%\end{Listing}


\subsection*{Finishing}
When all external references will be resolved, the framework can enter its last stage.
At this stage, the changed data should be packed into an output \gls{csar}, whose name was entered during the preprocessing stage.
The function $pack$ from the CSAR handler is used. 
After this operation, we become a more encapsulated CSAR.
Its level of Internet access during a deployment will be significantly lower.

\section{Language modules} 
This section will describe the language modules. %implementation of %TODO
%For this purpose serve \nameref{subs:archlm} and \nameref{subs:archpmm}.
Since the framework is initially oriented to easy extensibility, an abstract model for the modules will be defined, so that new modules can be added by implementing this model.
The implementation of the bash and ansible modules will be provided at the end of the section.

\subsection*{Language model}
To specify the common functionality and behavior of different language modules, the language model is used. 
In Java, this model is described by an abstract class. 
The abstract class $Language$ is presented in listing~\ref{lst:langabst}.
The common variables for all language modules are the name of the language, the list with package manager modules, and the extensions of files.
And here are the common functions presented: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $getName$ returns the name of this language.
	\item $getExtensions$ returns the list of extensions for this language.
	\item $proceed$ checks all original files.  
	Files written in the language should be transferred to every supported package manager module.
	\item $getNodeName$ uses a package name to generate the name for a Node Type, which will install the package using this language.
	\item $createTOSCA\_Node$ creates the definitions for a TOSCA node. 
	Since the created TOSCA nodes must install packages using the same language as the original node, all languages must provide the method for creating such definitions.
\end{itemize}
New language modules must be inherited from the language model and then can be added to the framework.

\subsection*{Bash module implementation}
The processing of the popular language was implemented. 
The bash module should accept only files written on the bash language.
To chose such files some signs inherent to all bash scripts can be used. 
These signs can be the file extensions (".sh" or ".bash") and the first line ("\#!/bin/bash"). 
Each file which contains those signs will be passed to supported package managers modules, in our case to the $apt$-$get$ module described later. \\
The bash module must provide a capability for the given package to create a definition of a TOSCA node which uses the bash language to install the package.
Such a bash TOSCA node is defined by the Package Type, the  Implementation, the  Artifact, and the Script Artifact.
The Package Type is a Node Type with an "$install$" operation and a name from the $getNodeName$ function.
The Package Implementation is a Node Type Implementation which refers the Package Artifact and the Script Artifact to implement the Package Type's "$install$" operation.
The Package Artifact and the Script Artifact are Artifact Templates referencing the installation data and a bash installation script respectively.
The installation script contains the bash header and an installation command, like "$dpkg$ -$i$ \textbf{installation\_data}".
The topology handler will instantiate the package node later by defining a Node Template.
Those definitions and the installation script are created by the $createTOSCA\_Node$ function.
%To avoid creating of the same nodes, the names of created nodes are stored in the $created\_packages$ list.
%Then the node name is generated using $getNodeName$ and TOSCA definitions for this name are created.

\subsection*{Ansible implementation}
To test the extensibility of the framework, the ansible language was added.
Since ansible playbooks are often packed into archives, it may be necessary to unpack them first and then to analyze the content.
Thus, the files are either immediately transferred to the package manager modules, or they are unzipped first.
Listing~\ref{lst:ansible_proceed} represents those operations.
As a sign of the ansible language, the ".$yml$" extension is used, since its playbooks don't contain any specific header.\\
Creating an ansible \gls{tosca} node for a package is a complicated operation. 
As the first step, the original files should be analyzed to determine the configuration (the set of options like a user name or a proxy server).
If the implemented analyzer is unable to find all necessary options, a user interface will be provided to fulfill any missing parameters.
Having the configuration a playbook and a configuration file will be created in a temporary folder.
After the installation data has been added to the folder, it can be packed to a zip archive.
This archive is an implementation artifact, which the Artifact Template should be created for.
A Node Type with an "$install$" operation % and a name built from the name of the package
should be defined.
And finally, a Node Type Implementation linking the operation and the Artifact Templates should be defined.
A Node Template will be added later by the topology handler.

\section{Package manager modules}
In this section, package manager modules will be specified.
Like languages, an abstract model will be defined to make the extensibility easier.
The apt-get module for bash and an apt module for ansible will be implemented.
\subsection*{Package manager model}
The model is described by an abstract class.
Its description contains only one function $proceed$ (in  listing~\ref{lst:pmabst}), that finds and eliminates external references, as well as passes the found package names to the package handler.
\subsection*{Apt-get for bash}
The apt-get package manager module is a simple line-by-line file parser which searches for the lines starting with the "$apt$-$get$ $install$" string, comments them out and passes this command's arguments to the package handler's public function $getPackage$. 
%The code can be found in the listing~\ref{lst:bash_apt_parse}.
\subsection*{Apt for ansible}
Since the package installation written in the $ansible$ language with the $apt$ package manager can be described in many different ways, then the processing will be a complicated task too.
It's worth mentioning that the processing uses a simple state machine and regular expression from the $java$.$util$.$regex$ package.

\section{Package Handler}
Package handler provides an interface for interaction with the package manager of the operating system.
It allows to download packages and to determine the type of dependencies between them.

\subsection*{Package downloading}
The download operation is performed using one recursive function $getPacket$. % defined in the listing \ref{lst:getpack}.
%\begin{Listing}
%\caption{The $getPackage$ definition}
%\label{lst:getpack}
%\begin{lstlisting}
%/**
%* Download package and check its dependency
%* 
%* @param language,  language name
%* @param packet, package name
%* @param listed, list with already included packages
%* @param source, name of package or file depending on the package
%* @param sourcefile, name of original file contained external reference.
%* @throws JAXBException
%* @throws IOException
%*/
%public void getPacket(Language language, String packet, List<String> listed, String source, String sourcefile)
%\end{lstlisting}
%\end{Listing}
The Arguments of the function will be defined shortly.
\begin{itemize}
	\item $language$ is a pointer to the language module which has accepted the original artifact.
	\item $packet$ is a name of the package.
	\item $listed$ holds a list with already downloaded packages.
	 It is not necessary to download them again, but new dependencies will be created.
	\item $source$ defines the parent element of the package. 
	It will be the original artifact file for the root package, and the depending package for other packages.
	\item $sourcefile$ is a name of the original artifact.
	%This name will be used by the $language$ to generate package node and by topology handler to create the dependency. 
\end{itemize}
This function downloads packages, calls the language's function $createTOSCA\_Node$ to create the TOSCA node for the package and the topology handler's functions $addDependencyToPacket$ or $addDependencyToArtifact$ to update the topology. Then this function calls itself recursively for all depended packages.
After those operations, a dependencies three for the $packet$ will be built.\\
The command $apt$-$get$ $download$ \emph{package} is used for downloading. 
If the process fails, a user input is provided to solve the problem. 
The user will be able to rename the package, ignore it or even break the processing.

\subsection*{Dependencies}
To determine the dependency type the $getDependensies$ function was developed.
It becomes a \emph{package} as an argument and uses the command $apt$-$cache$ $depends$ \emph{package} to build a list with dependencies for the \emph{package}. 
The $apt$-$cache$ command is a part of the $apt$-$get$ package manager and uses a packages database to print the dependencies.
The output is parsed to find strings like "Depends: \emph{dependent\_package}".
These dependent packages are combined to a list and returned back.
%An example output was presented in the section \ref{subs:dep}.

\section{Topology handling}\label{sec:imptophan}
The topology handler serves to update the TOSCA topology.
It builds the internal dependencies trees during the preprocessing stage.
Later the trees are used to find the right places for definitions of Node Templates and Dependency Templates.

\subsection*{Building internal dependencies trees}
At the preprocessing stage, this element analyzes all original definitions and constructs internal dependencies trees. %, as was described in the section~\ref{subs:analyse}.
To read those definitions from the XML files the package $org$.$w3c$.$dom$ was taken.\\
As the first step, all definitions of Artifact Templates are analyzed and pairs consist of an Artifact Template's ID and an artifact itself are built.
Then each Node Type Implementation will be read and Node Types and Artifact Template's IDs found. 
Now each artifact has a set with Node Types where it is used.
After the analysis of Service Templates, analog sets of Node Templates for each artifact will be created. 
In addition, for each Node Template one should keep a Service Templates, where this Node Template was defined.	

\subsection*{Updating Service Templates}
To update Service Templates two functions are provided.
\begin{itemize}
	\item $addDependencyToPacket(sourcePacket, targetPacket, dependencyType)$ generates a dependency between two package nodes.
	\item $addDependencyToArtifact(sourceArtifact, targetPacket)$ generates a dependency between the original node and a package node.
\end{itemize} 
Both functions find all Node Templates which instantiate the given $sourcePacket$ or $sourceArtifact$.
Besides, they find Service Templates where the Node Templates are defined.
The search is done with the help of the internal dependencies trees.
For each found Node Template a package node for the $targetPacket$ package should be instantiated by creating a new Node Template.
Then the dependency between the found Node Template and the new Node Template is created by defining a Relationship Template.
The Relationship Template references both Node Templates. 
The type of dependency is the value of the $dependencyType$ for the $addDependencyToPacket$ function and the $preDependsOn$ for the $addDependencyToArtifact$.\\
To update the existing TOSCA definition the $org$.$w3c$.$dom$ and $org$.$xml$.$sax$ packages are used. 
The definition of a new Node Template for the given $topology$ and $package$ is presented in listing \ref{lst:newnodetemp}.
\begin{Listing}
	\caption{Creating of a new Node Template}
	\label{lst:newnodetemp}
	\begin{lstlisting}  
	Element template = document.createElement("tosca_ns:NodeTemplate");
	template.setAttribute("xmlns:RRnt", RR_NodeType.Definitions.NodeType.targetNamespace);
	template.setAttribute("id", getID(package));
	template.setAttribute("name", package);
	template.setAttribute("type", "RRnt:" + RR_NodeType.getTypeName(package));
	topology.appendChild(template);
	\end{lstlisting}
\end{Listing}
